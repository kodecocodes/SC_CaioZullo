## Swift Code Katas: Getting Started

### Kata origin (in Martial Arts)

"Kata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approach, rather than as individuals in a disorderly manner."

"...Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.

### Code katas

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.

### Why do code katas

"How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time."

"...How do you get to be an All-Star sports person? Obviously fitness and talent help. But the great athletes spend hours and hours every day, practicing...."

"But in the software industry we take developers trained in the theory and throw them straight in to the deep-end, working on a project...."

"...In software we do our practicing on the job, and that’s why we make mistakes on the job. We need to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession."

> CodeKata by Dave Thomas (http://codekata.com/)


### Improving problem solving skills with katas

"Every now and then I challenge myself to build an application in a way I've never done before.

Choosing from a range of constraints, I try to forbid myself from using one or two techniques I'm used to, so I can find new ways of solving problems.

It's quite fun to write fully working iOS apps without booleans and if statements, for example. Yes, it's possible. I recommend you to try it..."

### Potential valuable learning paths for katas

- TDD (great starting point for new devs!)
- Functional programming (e.g. write an app with no mutation and/or no classes)
- Composition (e.g. try to separate code in tiny functions, as small as they can be – that's a great exercise to learn the possibilities and limits of modularity!)


## Proposition (2 videos)

### Swift Code Katas: Introduction

- Explain the goal and benefits of practicing katas

### Swift Code Katas: Game of Life

Introduction: Explain the kata and goals (Test-driven functional Game of Life)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Constraints for the kata: 
	- As simple as possible
		- Basic Foundation types (no classes, structs or enums)
	- Test driven
	- No mutation - only pure functions and immutable data

# Potential audience challenges:

- Improve performance (without mutation!)
- Implement a simple user interface to play the game
- Improve the code with custom types (fix Primitive Obsession)
- Add time machine functionality (go back in time with a scroll bar)
	- Should be easy to implement since it's data-driven from immutable data)
