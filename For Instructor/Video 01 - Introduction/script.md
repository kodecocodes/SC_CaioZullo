## Intro 

Hello everybody, this is Caio. In this video we're going to introduce you to a really cool practice that will help you improve your skills as a developer: Code Katas!

Kata is a Japanese word for the practice of choreographed patterns of movements. Practicing Katas is successful in martial arts for mastering, preserving and passing on movements and techniques using a systematic approach either solo or in pairs. 

The practice of Katas involves a lot of repetition, but they are not meant to be permanently rigid as it may sound. Once you master a kata, you should be able to execute and adapt it under different circumstances.

Have you ever watched a movie with a Karate master practicing alone, hitting perfectly timed and smooth punches and kicks to the air? That's a Kata!

A code kata follows the same idea. They are exercises which helps programmers master their skills through practice and repetition. 

Great musicians, athletes, surgeons, pilots, and many other professions are mastered through practicing hours and hours every day. In the software industry it is quite common to practice on the job, so we make a lot of mistakes on the job.

Code katas are meant to split the practice from the profession, so we can become better and better at what we do.

## Constraints

Another great use for katas is to improve or learn a new skill by setting up constraints to your practice. Have you ever tried to write code without `if` statements? Well, you definitely can! Have you ever tried to write code without using the `var` keyword? That can be great to improve your functional programming skills! Have you ever seen a karate master fighting with one hand tied? Cool, right?!

I don't recommend trying the last one, but by setting up constraints, you limit yourself from relying on your default techniques, which is a great practice to learn new ways to solve problems.

## Closing 

In following videos we'll practice our first Swift Code Katas together.
